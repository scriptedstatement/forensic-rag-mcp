Filesystem Safety Module - Guarded filesystem operations.

This module provides safe wrappers for destructive filesystem operations
to prevent accidental deletion of important data. All destructive operations
(rmtree, unlink) require:

1. Path is within an allowed root directory
2. Path is not a forbidden system path
3. Directory contains a sentinel file (.rag_mcp_managed)

Usage:
    from rag_mcp.fs_safety import safe_rmtree, safe_mkdir, create_sentinel

    # Create a managed directory
    safe_mkdir(some_path, root=DATA_ROOT)
    create_sentinel(some_path)

    # Later, safely remove it
    safe_rmtree(some_path, root=DATA_ROOT)  # Only works if sentinel exists
